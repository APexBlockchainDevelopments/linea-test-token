# **Linea Test Token dApp**

## **Overview**
The Linea Test Token dApp is a decentralized application built on the Linea Sepolia network. It allows users to interact with the `Linea Test Token` smart contract by minting tokens, withdrawing funds, and updating the admin address. The dApp is built with React and integrates with MetaMask for seamless interaction with the blockchain.

## **Features**
- **Mint Tokens**: Users can send ETH in WEI to the contract, which will mint an equivalent amount of Linea Test Token (LTT) at a 1:1 ratio.
- **Withdraw Funds**: The contract owner can withdraw all ETH collected by the contract.
- **Update Admin Address**: The contract owner can update the admin address of the contract.
- **Total Supply Display**: The total supply of Linea Test Token (LTT) is displayed on the dApp, updating in real-time as tokens are minted.
- **Network Switching**: Users can easily switch to the Linea Sepolia network directly from the dApp.
- **Add Token to MetaMask**: Users can add the Linea Test Token (LTT) to their MetaMask wallet with a single click.


## **Prerequisites**
- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
- **MetaMask**: Install the MetaMask browser extension and connect it to the Linea Sepolia network.
